## 🏁 Challenge

Our team loves the space, but as our time is short, we are not always able to follow everything on the fly!

So we need an app that can quickly provide us with information on what rocket flights are currently planned for the near future.

### Details ###
Create project `Space-Challenge`.

To get started use [The Space Devs API](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi) for launches. Note that API can be used only 15 times per hour.

Display upcoming events on list, and when tapped, it should present a modal that will display more information about the launch.

The challenge should take around 2-4 hours. The submitted code should reflect what you feel represents your best work.

You should be prepared to talk about your solution in an interview setting.

### Requirements ###

* Use [The Space Devs API](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi)
* On app launch, upcoming launches should be fetched and displayed, starting with today's date
* Scrolling loads launches for future weeks
* Tapping on a cell should present a launch details modal
* Use of 3rd party libraries is allowed. But, be thoughtful about which libraries are used and why

### What are we looking for? ###

* Solid architecture
* Use of design patterns
* Familiarity with mobile frameworks
* Submit what you feel represents your best work
* Testability
